# Latency Compensation in Autonomous Driving

Code for the research project under the guidance of Prof. Jaerock Kwon.

1. Source `init.sh`
2. Make sure that `jaerock/oscar/config/config.yaml` points to `fusion_sanjyot`
3. Change directory to `sanjyot/latcom`
4. Create conda environment from `tf1.yml` file
